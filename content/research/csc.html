I work on the [Common Sense Computing Initiative][csc], which aims to
collect the things people know and computers don't and make them available
to computer algorithms.

Part of my research in the Media Lab involves developing and maintaining a
lexical resource called [ConceptNet][], which makes millions of statements of
general human knowledge (in English, Japanese, and several other languages)
available in the form of a semantic network.

I also work on a Python library called [Divisi][], which provides the labeled
sparse and dense matrix operations you need to do many kinds of machine
learning, particularly if you're reasoning over ConceptNet using
[AnalogySpace][].

All of these things are open source, with code available on [GitHub][].

The [CSCI site][csc] has more details on all of these, including posts about
what I've been up to recently and a reasonable amount of documentation.
