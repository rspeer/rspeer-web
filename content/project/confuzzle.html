## The CONFUZZLE wordlist

<img src="{{media_url('img/confuzzle-sample.png')}}" class="floatright"/>
There are lots of text files that list the words you can use in word games like
Scrabble. (Some of them are more accurate than others.) But as far as I know,
this is the only one that you can print on 17 double-sided sheets of
letter-size paper.

The words in the list come from the excellent, public-domain ENABLE2K word
list, compiled by Mendel Cooper. His website is sadly defunct, but the wordlist
has become a standard for word games and puzzles.

* The file: [confuzzle.pdf][]
* LaTeX source: [confuzzle.tex][]
* The source wordlist: [enable.txt][]

Why would you want a wordlist on paper instead of a computer file? The same
reason you'd want to play word games on a board instead of on a computer.
Sometimes, you'd rather face the person you're playing against than have your
face in a laptop.

## How the list works

The list only contains words, not their definitions. Still, given that there
are over 170,000 words in the list, it takes some effort -- beyond just using a
6-point font -- to fit them on 34 pages.

This economy of printed space is accomplished through a form of human-readable
compression. When many consecutive words in alphabetical order start with the
same letters, as they tend to do, they are grouped together like this:

    ALLOTYP- e es ic ically ies y

The grouping was chosen by an algorithm, not by a lexicographer, so sometimes
words are grouped in odd ways:

    NONSOL- ar id ids ution utions

I've also marked the differences between ENABLE and the more well-known
standard, the Official Tournament and Club Word List 2 (OWL2). These markings
are not authoritative, because I don't have an electronic file of OWL2. I
compiled the differences mainly from [this National Scrabble Association
page][nsa].

Locating the code that chose the groupings will, unfortunately, take a bit of
hard-drive archaeology. I made the list in 2003, updated it for OWL2 in 2006,
and updated it manually in 2011 to incorporate the National Scrabble
Association's errata to OWL2.
