I've heard Radiohead's new album, The King of Limbs, described as both a
brilliant new sound for the band and "bottom-of-the-barrel electronica". I find
myself agreeing with both in different parts of the album.

The album is good enough for me to listen to it repeatedly. It's no "OK
Computer". It's not even an "In Rainbows". It doesn't have much cohesion as an
album, as far as I can tell, which is a bit disappointing: I enjoy albums where
you have to listen to the whole thing to get the full effect, but as far as I
can tell, TKOL has just the same effect when you listen one track at a time,
plus you get to skip the bad tracks.

The interesting thing I've found, from looking at reviews, is that different
people have wildly different opinions about different tracks. Might as well add
mine to the pile.

* The first track, "Bloom", strikes me as seriously half-assed. I know Radiohead
  usually saves the best stuff for the middle of the album and uses the first
  track just to establish the sound of the album, but this *isn't* what the
  rest of the album sounds like (thankfully). It's mostly an arrhythmic, out of
  context drum sample that's forcibly looped to the intended length of a
  measure, and then they sing over it. We know by now that Radiohead is capable
  of making mind-expanding music, so this track seems to show some cynicism
  about the state of alternative music by the band. "Hey look," they say, "we
  can sample a few seconds of weird shit and loop it and people will think it's
  good music".

* "Morning Mr. Magpie" at least goes somewhere, but doesn't inspire too much
  confidence after "Bloom". It's got a listenable rhythm, at least, but it's
  also got about one and a half chords in the whole song. It doesn't help that
  Thom Yorke's characteristically whiny voice is actually whining in the
  lyrics: "You stole it all. Give it back."

* "Little by Little" is where things really get going. The melody, rhythm, and
  chord structure are all doing surprising and interesting things, with odd
  instrumentation (some of it played backwards) that gives an overall effect of
  listening to a classic James Bond theme that's been disassembled and rebuilt
  as 2010s alternative rock.

* "Feral" is electronic and loopy like "Bloom", but at least it doesn't actively
  sound bad. It might even sound good. It's hard to tell. Mostly my conclusion
  about this track is that Radiohead is actively screwing with my tastes in
  music. They like to do that. "Lotus Flower" takes the same kind of sound and
  then builds an actual song on it, and at this point it really does sound good.
  If you go watch the music video, incidentally, you'll notice that they also
  enjoy screwing with your taste in choreography.

* "Codex" is the reason to listen to the album. It's freaking beautiful and it
  reminds me of their magnum opus "Exit Music" in some intangible way, while
  also doing something completely new for Radiohead with its use of the brass
  section.  I'm wondering if "Codex" is the only thing that keeps me coming
  back to listen to the album again, especially since I tend to loop it about
  three times (which incidentally makes the album actually a reasonable length
  for an album instead of an EP). I hope it isn't, and I think at least some of
  the other tracks can hold their own.

* "Give Up the Ghost" is okay and has some pretty nice acoustic guitar, but the
  repeated sample of "don't hurt me" gets old.
  
* Finally, "Separator" is a solid
  moderately-upbeat Radiohead song with a clever electric guitar riff that
  would have fit in perfectly well on In Rainbows, and the only disappointing
  thing about it is the fact that the album just *ends* after it. It's not
  really an album-ending song.  There's no denouement, nothing that makes you
  think about what you've been listening to for the last 40 minutes, you just
  get to the end of a song and then there isn't any music anymore.

Some obsessive Radiohead fans have found that you can get a
reasonable album by alternating tracks from The King of Limbs and Kid
A. They even have contrived numerological justifications for their ordering. I
think it's just because Kid A has an album structure and TKOL is a pile of
songs, some of them good, in search of an album.

Now is as good a time as any to establish a rating scale in case I plan to
write more of these. And this is as good an album as any to establish the
midpoint of the scale. It isn't a bad album. It isn't a good album. It's just
one I'd listen to. **3.0 out of 5**.
