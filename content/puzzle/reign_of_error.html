<i>This is a short "Mystery Hunt-style" puzzle. This means you're given the
information you need to get to a unique solution, but not told what to do with
it.</i>

<i>The puzzle was originally written for a French Revolution-themed puzzle
hunt. The answer will be a four-letter word. You can check your solution
[here][solution].</i>

<i>Incidentally, based on feedback from unsuccessful test-solvers, this puzzle
is probably too hard. If you do manage to get it, congratulations and

## Reign of Error

I have lined up here almost all of the enemies of the Revolution!
Unfortunately, one remains in hiding, but she will inevitably meet the same
fate.
