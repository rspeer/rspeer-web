## Reign of Error (solution)

A few clues point to the basic mechanism of this puzzle:

* The French Revolution theme.
* The fact that "Error" is "Terror" with the first letter removed.
* The fact that the flavortext above the puzzle is written in the voice of
  Robespierre, a pun on my name.

How did Robespierre solve the problem (as he perceived) that he was surrounded
by enemies of the Revolution? By chopping off heads. Likewise, the first thing
you need to do to solve this problem is to chop off the heads (first letters)
of these nonsense words.

    a SRA
    e RTH
    g MAN
    g NDQ
    i NCH
    j MIL
    k YOU
    l THE
    n ERD
    o FRE
    q EAP
    r OCO
    u EAD
    v CTJ
    w DEC
    x LLE
    y IKE
    z IPH

Many of the remaining three-letter fragments are letter sequences that are
likely to occur in English (although there are some ugly ones like NDQ). This
tends to indicate that they should be assembled into a message. In fact, making
a message out of three-letter fragments is a common style of puzzle which the
NPL calls an "anaquote" or "anaquip".

The question marks below the puzzle help by showing the lengths of the words in
the message. Except... there are 9 too few of them. And there are 9 words. How
do you make them fit? By chopping off more heads, of course. With the "heads"
in lowercase, you can make this message:

    oCOLLECT jYOUR tHEADS rAND qDECIPHER dTHEM iLIKE eA pFRENCHMAN

Of course, you're going to need to refer to what you did before to solve the
puzzle. Here's the order you have to put the four-letter chunks in to make this
message:

    rOCO
    xLLE
    vCTU
    kYOU
    eRTH
    uEAD
    aSRA
    gNDQ
    wDEC
    zIPH
    nERD
    lTHE
    jMIL
    yIKE
    qEAP
    oFRE
    iNCH
    gMAN

The heads of the four-letter chunks are "RXVKEUAGWZNLJYQOIG", and the heads of
the message are "OJTRQDIEP", and you're asked to "decipher them like a
Frenchman". This is a Vigenere cipher, with the long phrase as the ciphertext
and the short phrase as the key. If you decode the Vigenere cipher
([here](http://sharkysoft.com/misc/vigenere/) is one site that does that), the
cleartext is:

    DOCTORSCHLESSINGER

This is who the puzzle describes as the "enemy in hiding" -- it's cluing the
talk-radio host better known as Dr. Laura. To finish the puzzle, you have to
"behead" the answer to the clue like all the other enemies of the Revolution,
removing the first letter of LAURA to get the solution, AURA.
