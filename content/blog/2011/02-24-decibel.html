title: I've noticed that Decibel Audio Player is unreasonably devoted to completeness when it comes to particularly long titles of indie music.

I was listening to Sufjan Stevens' "Illinoise". I found myself wondering why my
music player had decided to splay itself out across three desktops. Then I
remembered I was listening to Sufjan Stevens' "Illinoise".

The player, incidentally, is Decibel Audio Player. Regardless of this amusing
feature of its interface, it's by far the best audio player I've found for
music collections that are organized by folders. (ID3 tags are designed for
people who only listen to certain kinds of popular music.)
