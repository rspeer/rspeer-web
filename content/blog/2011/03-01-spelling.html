## The Speln Ncerector

Today I was experimenting with using a machine translation toolkit on problems
besides translation. My first experiment was to try to make a system that would
take in a word it hasn't seen before and guess how it was pronounced.

I think I accidentally ran something backwards, because what I got was a system
that takes in the legitimate pronunciation of a word, and usually outputs a
creative new spelling that it hasn't seen before.

*I have created a spelling incorrector.*

Or, as it would say:

I am not kidding. Those are the actual spellings my backwards-wired system
gives for dictionary pronunciations of those words, including spelling
"usually" as "ugly". And I promise you that I was cringing while typing things
like "axedently" and "2 tri 2 mak".
