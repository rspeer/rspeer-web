When I came across a [JavaScript library][isotope]
for making interesting-looking layouts out of a series of haphazard boxes,
my first thought was wondering why I'd ever want to make a website that
disorganized. My second thought was that I needed a new personal website
anyway.

I had a website before, and despite that it was a Wiki that was easy to update,
I managed not to update it since before I was in graduate school. Now I'm
finally making one again, and it's a chance to experiment with weird cool stuff
I can do with a web site. In addition to [isotope][] for the listing pages, I'm
using [hyde][], a Python site generator, to generate the HTML for the rest of
the site.

Basically, I intend for this site to jumble together all my projects and
thoughts indiscriminately. Yes, it may juxtapose serious research, music,
puzzles, and geeky posts about video games. That's how the site works because
that's me.
