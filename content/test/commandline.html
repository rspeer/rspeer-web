§§ blurb

The hyde command line supports three subcommands:

1. create - Initializes a new site at a given path
2. gen - Generates the website to a configured deploy folder
3. serve - Starts a local http server that regenerates based on the requested file

§§ /blurb

## The create command

Creates a new hyde website.

~~~sh~~~
hyde create

hyde [-s </site/path>] [-v] create [-l <layout>] [-f] [-h]
~~~~~~~~

`-s SITEPATH, --sitepath SITEPATH`
:   Where the site must be created. If this path is not empty then the `-f`
    option must be specified to overwrite the site.

    *Optional* - defaults to current working directory.

`-f, --force`
:   Specifying this option will overwrite files and folders at the given
    site path.

    *Optional* - If the target directory is not empty, hyde will throw an
    exception unless this is specified.

`-l LAYOUT, --layout LAYOUT`
:   The name of the layout to use for creating the initial site. Hyde currently
    has three layouts: `basic`, `test` and `doc`.

    While basic and test are really barebones, doc is the one that generates
    this documentation and is completely usable. Hyde will get more layouts
    over time.

    Hyde tries to locate the specified layout in the following folders:

    1.  In `layouts` folder under the path specified by the `HYDE_DATA`
    environment variable
    2.  In `layouts` folder under hyde

    *Optional* - defaults to `basic`

`-v, --verbose`
:   Logs detailed messages to the console.

    *Optional* - shows only essential messages if this option is omitted.

`-h`
:   Displays the help text for the `create` command.

Assuming the `HYDE_DATA` environment variable is empty and the folder
`~/test` is empty, the following command will create a new hyde site
at `~/test` with the contents of `layouts/doc` folder:

~~~sh~~~
hyde -s ~/test create -l doc
~~~~~~~~

## The generate command

Generates the given website.

~~~sh~~~
hyde gen

hyde [-s </site/path>] [-v] gen [-d </deploy/path>] [-c <config/path>] [-h]
~~~~~~~~

`-s SITEPATH, --sitepath SITEPATH`
:   The path to the site to be generated.

    *Optional* - defaults to current working directory.

`-d DEPLOY_PATH, --deploy-path DEPLOY_PATH`
:   Location where the site should be generated. This option overrides any
    setting specified in the hyde [configuration][]. The path is assumed to
    be relative to the site path unless a preceding path separator is found.

    *Optional* - Uses what is specified in the config file. The default option
    in the configuration file is: `deploy` folder under the current site path.


`-c CONFIG, --config-path CONFIG`
:   This is used for specifying an alternate configuration file to use for
    generating the site. This is useful if you have two different configurations
    for you production versus development websites.

    The path is assumed to be relative to the site path unless a preceding path
    separator is found.

    *Optional* - defaults to `site.yaml`

`-v, --verbose`
:   Logs detailed messages to the console.

    *Optional* - shows only essential messages if this option is omitted.

`-h`
:   Displays the help text for the `gen` command.

The following command will use `production.yaml` as the configuration file and
generate the website at `~/test` to `~/production_site` directory.

~~~sh~~~
cd ~/test
hyde gen -c production.yaml -d ~/production_site
~~~~~~~~

## The serve command

Starts the built in web server that also regenerates based on the request if there are
changes.

~~~sh~~~
hyde serve

hyde [-s </site/path>] [-v] gen [-d </deploy/path>] [-c <config/path>] [-h]
~~~~~~~~

`-s SITEPATH, --sitepath SITEPATH`
`-d DEPLOY_PATH, --deploy-path DEPLOY_PATH`
`-c CONFIG, --config-path CONFIG`

:   Since the `serve` command auto generates if there is a need, it needs
    the same parameters as the `gen` command. The above parameters serve
    the same purpose here as in the `gen` command.

`-a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS`

:   The address to serve the website.

    *Optional* - defaults to `localhost`

`-p PORT, --port`

:   The port to serve the website.

    *Optional* - defaults to `8080`

`-h`

:   Displays the help text for the `serve` command.

    The following command will serve the website at `http://localhost:8181`

~~~sh~~~
cd ~/test
hyde serve -p 8181
~~~~~~~~
