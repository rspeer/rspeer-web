*Metastable Dance* is a modern string quartet that I composed in 2005. The time
signature shifts throughout the piece but settles into 5/4 for the main theme.

It was performed by a string quartet that was visiting MIT, who prefer
to remain anonymous because of the fact that they didn't rehearse much for this
recording. Regardless, it still came out sounding pretty good.
